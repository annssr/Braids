# Braids
Used Processing IDE to create a UI toolkit for drawing a configurable PCC (Piecewise Circular Curve) along a given set of points, rendering several braids revolving around said PCC, then twisting and tightening them in several repeating patterns, including sin, cos, and alternating sin-cos.

## Basic tutorial
When initially running the Ceditor program, there will be a blank triangle. Press j and then press ; to show elbows and then show the lattice structure.

To see inside the lattice structure, press ; to hide the colored rendered elbows.

To see the paths clearly, hide the lattice structure and press 2 to add paths. (Press s to remove paths)

## Additional key functions

| [ and ]	| Twist Original Black Path 'P' Clockwise and Counterclockwise respectively|
| 1	| Add / Remove the rendering buffer for increased performance|
| / |	Reset Elbow Twists to 0|
|	-	| TIghten the twists/braids|
| h	| Switch Tangent Methods|
| 2	| Increase the number of paths|

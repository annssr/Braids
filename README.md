# Braids
Used Processing IDE to create a UI toolkit for drawing a configurable PCC (Piecewise Circular Curve) along a given set of points, rendering several braids revolving around said PCC, then twisting and tightening them in several repeating patterns, including sin, cos, and alternating sin-cos.

## Basic tutorial
When initially running the Ceditor program, there will be a blank triangle. Press j and then press ; to show elbows and then show the lattice structure.

To see inside the lattice structure, press ; to hide the colored rendered elbows.

To see the paths clearly, hide the lattice structure and press 2 to add paths. (Press s to remove paths)
